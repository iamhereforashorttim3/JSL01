# JSL01 Challenge

---
## Overview:
I had to recreate a Figma design that I was given, and make sure that the Desktop
and Mobile layout were responsive to different screen sizes and user-friendly, so adding
in hover effects for Desktop.
The Figma Design: https://www.figma.com/design/y7bFCUYL5ZHfPeojACBXg2/Challenge-1-%7C-JSL?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=0yNqtUuyQcxXldJw-0

## Technolgies Used:
* HTML
* CSS

## Additional features created:
* Hover effects that make Icons darker/lighter when hovered over
* Cursor turns into a pointer when hovering over icons


### How to run the files:
 1. Download the styles.css/index.html and place both in a new folder
 2. Go to VScode open the folder, and press "Go Live" at the bottom right corner
 3. To see the Mobile responsiveness, inspect element, click the dimensions dropdown and select a device to view from

## Initial challenges:
* Trying to recreate the layout in the figma design
* Making sure that everything was practically pixel perfect
* Mobile responsive design

## How did I overcome the challenges?
* I managed the sidebar on it's on and adjusted it until it resembled the reference,
then grouped the to-do list and Launch Career together so any changes made layout wise would happen
to the both of them.
* I realized that not everything has to be pixel perfect, but as long as it deeply resembles
 the reference that is what matters
* Watching tutorials/reading websites on how to properly make mobile responsiveness assisted me greatly

# What I have learnt through the challenge?
* How to create more complex layouts that require you to come with a creative approach
* Being able to create a desktop/mobile layout that is truly responsive, with no sacrifces in quality
with the use of properties like, Box-sizing: border-box and Object-fit.
